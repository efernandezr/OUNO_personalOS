# Personal Context Collection Guide

> Your stories are your unfair advantage. They make your content authentic, memorable, and impossible to replicate.

## Why Personal Context Matters

| Without Stories | With Stories |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Generic advice anyone could give | Unique perspective only you have |
| Forgettable content | Memorable narratives |
| "Expert says..." | "I learned this when..." |
| Easily replicated by AI | Authentically human |

**Goal**: Build a library of 20-30 stories with good coverage across your content pillars.

## Story Categories to Collect

Stories where you changed your mind, approach, or capabilities.

**Mining Prompts**:

## Collection Workflow

### Weekly Habit (5-10 minutes)

**Trigger**: End of week review or Friday afternoon

**Process**:
1. Ask yourself: "What story did I tell this week?"
   - In meetings, presentations, or conversations
   - To explain a point or share a lesson
2. If you told a story, capture it with `/add-story`
3. Include: one-liner, themes, when to use it

**Why it works**: You naturally tell stories when they're relevant. Capture them when fresh.

### Monthly Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Trigger**: First Monday of month or monthly planning session

**Process**:
1. Review your calendar for the past month
2. For each significant meeting/project, ask:
   - Did I learn something worth sharing?
   - Did something go wrong that taught me a lesson?
   - Did I achieve something notable?
3. Add 2-3 new stories using `/add-story --full`
4. Review existing stories - any need refinement?

**Why it works**: Calendar review triggers memory of experiences you might forget.

### Quarterly Audit (1 hour)

**Trigger**: End of quarter

**Process**:
1. Open `config/personal-context.yaml` and review all stories
2. Check coverage against pillars (use table below)
3. Identify gaps - which pillars have few stories?
4. Set intention to capture stories in gap areas
5. Refine weak stories - add specifics, sharpen lessons
6. Archive stories that no longer feel authentic

**Coverage Audit Template**:

| Pillar | Stories | Gap? |
|--------|---------|------|
| AI for Marketing | ___ | |
| Claude Code for Marketing | ___ | |
| AI Agents for Marketing | ___ | |
| Building Agents | ___ | |
| Digital Marketing Maturity | ___ | |

## Quality Standards

### A Good Story Has:

1. **Specificity**: Names, numbers, timeframes, details
   - Bad: "A project I worked on"
   - Good: "The Q3 2024 APAC rollout with 40% adoption challenge"

2. **Tension**: Something at stake, a challenge, a risk
   - Bad: "We implemented the tool successfully"
   - Good: "With no budget and skeptical leadership, we..."

3. **Transformation**: Change from before to after
   - Bad: "I learned about AI"
   - Good: "I went from AI skeptic to building my own agents"

4. **Universal Lesson**: Takeaway others can apply
   - Bad: "It worked for us"
   - Good: "This taught me that big transformations start with small wins"

5. **Authenticity**: Uniquely yours, not generic
   - Bad: "Failure is the best teacher"
   - Good: "When my first AI project crashed, I realized I'd been solving the wrong problem"

### Red Flags to Avoid:

- **Too vague**: "I learned a lot from that experience"
- **No stakes**: "Everything went smoothly"
- **Generic lesson**: "Hard work pays off"
- **Not yours**: "I heard about someone who..."
- **No specifics**: "A few years ago, somewhere..."

## Story Mining Exercises

When you're stuck finding stories, try these exercises:

### The Career Timeline
Draw your career timeline. Mark:
- Major transitions (jobs, roles, pivots)
- Big wins (projects, promotions, recognition)
- Big failures (setbacks, mistakes, learning moments)
- Key people (mentors, collaborators, rivals)

Each mark is a potential story.

### The "I Used to Think..." Exercise
Complete these sentences:
- "I used to think... but now I know..."
- "Everyone told me... but I learned..."
- "The conventional wisdom is... but my experience showed..."

Each completion is a transformation story.

### The Advice Audit
What advice do you give repeatedly? Each piece of advice has a story behind it:
- Why do you believe this?
- How did you learn it?
- What happened when you ignored it?

### The Outsider's View
Ask a colleague or friend:
- "What stories have you heard me tell multiple times?"
- "What do I seem to know that others don't?"
- "What experiences shaped how I work?"
